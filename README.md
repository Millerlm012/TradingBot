# TradingBot
Trading bot that utilizes the Alpaca API to make trades based on a trading stategy. The trading strategy to be utilized is the three bar strategy.

About: This was a project I completed over 1.5 week winter break for my brother in 2019. The program gathers stock data and utilizes the Alpaca API to submit trades.
We were able to test all trades on Alpaca with a paper trading account. The program was more of a proof of concept to my brother that the three bar strategy of trading
would not work. This was my first large project that I've programmed and as you can tell from the branches, my first time using github.
