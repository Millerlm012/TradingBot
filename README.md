# TradingBot
Trading bot that utilizes the Alpaca API to make trades based on a trading stategy. The trading strategy to be utilized is the three bar strategy. I believe main_v5.py is the most up to date code that I created.

About: This was a project I completed over 1.5 week winter break for my brother in late 2019/early 2020. The program gathers stock data and utilizes the Alpaca API to submit trades.
We were able to test all trades on Alpaca with a paper trading account. The program was more of a proof of concept to my brother that the three bar strategy of trading would not work. This was my first large project that I've programmed while trying to use github. I've since learned how to use git and github seemlessly.

NOTE: For any goons attempting to access the accounts - all config files that use different API keys are deprecated lol. :)
